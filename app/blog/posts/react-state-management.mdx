title: "Understanding React State Management"
publishedAt: "2024-10-07"
summary: "React state management is a crucial aspect of building complex applications. It allows developers to manage and share data across components efficiently."

While learning React back in 2022, state was one of the most confusing topics for me. I remember staying up late at night on few occasions trying to figure out why it was vital to building React applications, and what made it so special. It's 2024 now, I still learn new things about state and I've come to realize that state is the lifeblood of any React application. This article is a simple guide to understanding state in React and I hope you find it helpful and informative. Cheers to learning! üéâ

### Introduction

A react application can be described as a sea of components working together for usually two purposes. To display UI to users and to provide a way for users to interact with UI.
The bulk of React applications in the world revolve around these two purposes.

### What does it mean for a component to have state?

State is a vital part of every React application. State is how you make react components come alive. When a component has state, it can help you remember when data changes and reflects the new data in the UI.
So how then do you know whether to give a component state? What‚Äôs the importance of giving a component state? Must all your React components have state?
To answer these questions, we need to explore what it means to give a component state.

In simple words, giving a component state is you telling the component

> Heyy, I‚Äôm giving you state because I want you to help me remember something. I need you to help me track a particular piece of data, and when that data changes, refresh yourself and display the new data to the user.

So in summary, state is simply a component‚Äôs memory. It is a way for components to remember¬†‚Äòthings‚Äô.

### What Should a Component Remember?

When I mean that state is a way for components to remember things, the things in context is simply data.
React applications are data-driven. This means that they are strongly influenced by data.
Let‚Äôs break this down. I read an article by expert Engineer Kent C Dodds. In this article he quoted something saying, ‚ÄúUser interfaces are just a skin over some data.‚Äù What this means is that a React application is the interface between data and users.
And the amazing thing about data is that it changes, it‚Äôs dynamic, it doesn‚Äôt always remain constant.

### An Example

When you go to the bank, you usually want to go interact with some ‚Äòdata‚Äô. See the bank as a React application. The data in context is your money. Remember that data is dynamic, it changes, it doesn‚Äôt always remain constant. So at the bank you can add to your money, subtract from it or do anything you want with it.
But somehow, you can‚Äôt just walk into any bank and go directly to where your money is kept. You need some interface, a skin over your data, you need to interact with the bank official. In this context, this is our user interface. When you get a deposit, your data changes and then the bank official needs to fetch your new balance and then display it to you. As you interact with the bank thereby causing the data to change, that's how a user interacts with a React application, also causing the data to change.

Here are examples of how a user can interact with a React application and cause the data to change. A user can:

- Click a button to add to their money
- Click a button to subtract from their money
- Click a button to transfer money to another account
- Click a button to withdraw money from their account
- A user can click a button to deposit money to their account
- Submit a form to change app password
- Add a song to a music playlist
- Add a product to a shopping cart
- Delete a post on a social media app

All these interactions cause the data to change. A React application needs to be smart enough to know when the data changes and then reflect that change in the UI. The way to give a React application this ability is by giving it **state**.

Now, let's explore this React component. It's a straightforward bank application that enables you to deposit and withdraw funds. Feel free to experiment with saving and withdrawing some money.

<BankApp />

<br />

You may observe that your balance remains unchanged when you click the buttons. Why is this so? Why does the balance seem stuck? To answer these question, let's take a look at the code and what happens in the console. Try clicking the buttons once again and observe the console.

<br />

<Editable />

Voila! Our balance actually gets updated but it doesn't get displayed in our user interface. This is because the JSX part of the React code doesnt know that the balance has changed. As shown in the console, the balance variable gets updated each time we click the buttons but the UI isn't aware about this change, so it just keeps displaying the initial balance.

Like the bank example I gave earlier, imagine that you make some deposits and withdrawals to your account. You go to the bank to check your balance and discover that your balance is not updated. This is because the bank official isn't aware of the changes you made to your account. So he has to find a way to remember the data changes you made to your account. Likewise in React applications, we need to find a way to give components the ability to remember data changes and then display the new data to the user. This is where state comes in.

### How do we fix this?

We need to give our balance state to the JSX part of the React code. We can do this by using the useState hook. According to the React documentation,

> useState is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component.

The useState hook takes an initial value which could be a number, string, boolean, array, object, etc. and then returns an array with two values. The _first value_ is the state variable and the _second value_ is a function that allows us to update the state variable.

```tsx
const [balance, setBalance] = useState(1000000);
```

In our case:

- _balance_ is the state variable
- _setBalance_ is a function that React provides for us to update the state variable

Now when the data changes, React is aware of it and would automatically refresh the UI to display the new data. This is the magic of state in React. Let's see how this works in the code.

<ExampleWithState />

Now our balance gets updated and displayed correctly because our React application is aware of the changes.

Let's see another example.
