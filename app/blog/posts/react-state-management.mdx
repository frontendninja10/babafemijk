While learning React back in 2022, state was one of the most confusing topics for me. I remember staying up late at night on few occasions trying to figure out why it was vital to building React applications, and what made it so special. It's 2024 now, I still learn new things about state and I've come to realize that state is the lifeblood of any React application.

A react application can be described as a sea of components working together for usually two purposes. To display UI to users and to provide a way for users to interact with UI.
The bulk of React applications in the world revolve around these two purposes.

### Introduction

State management refers to the process of managing the state of an application. The state of an application is the data that the application needs to function. It can include things like user data, application data, and more.

### What does it mean for a component to have state?

State is a vital part of every React application. State is how you make react components come alive. When a component has state, it can help you remember when data changes and reflects the new data in the UI.
So how then do you know whether to give a component state? What’s the importance of giving a component state? Must all your React components have state?
To answer these questions, we need to explore what it means to give a component state.

In simple words, giving a component state is you telling the component

> Heyy, I’m giving you state because I want you to help me remember something. I need you to help me track a particular piece of data, and when that data changes, refresh yourself and display the new data to the user.

So in summary, state is simply a component’s memory. It is a way for components to remember ‘things’.

### What Should a Component Remember?

When I mean that state is a way for components to remember things, the things in context is simply data.
React applications are data-driven. This means that they are strongly influenced by data.
Let’s break this down. I read an article by expert Engineer Kent C Dodds. In this article he quoted something saying, “User interfaces are just a skin over some data.” What this means is that a React application is the interface between data and users.
And the amazing thing about data is that it changes, it’s dynamic, it doesn’t always remain constant.

### An Example

When you go to the bank, you usually want to go interact with some ‘data’. See the bank as a React application. The data in context is your money. Remember that data is dynamic, it changes, it doesn’t always remain constant. So at the bank you can add to your money, subtract from it or do anything you want with it.
But somehow, you can’t just walk into any bank and go directly to where your money is kept. You need some interface, a skin over your data, you need to interact with the bank official. In this context, this is our user interface. When you get a deposit, your data changes and then the bank official needs to fetch your new balance and then display it to you. As you interact with the bank thereby causing the data to change, that's how a user interacts with a React application, also causing the data to change.

Here are examples of how a user can interact with a React application and cause the data to change. A user can:

- Click a button to add to their money
- Click a button to subtract from their money
- Click a button to transfer money to another account
- Click a button to withdraw money from their account
- A user can click a button to deposit money to their account
- Submit a form to change app password
- Add a song to a music playlist
- Add a product to a shopping cart
- Delete a post on a social media app

All these interactions cause the data to change. A React application needs to be smart enough to know when the data changes and then reflect that change in the UI. The way to give a React application this ability is by giving it **state**.

Let's take a look at this react component. It's a simple bank app that allows users to deposit and withdraw money.
